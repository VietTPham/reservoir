***
Please familiarize yourself with the [DSLP](https://github.com/dslp/dslp)'s definition of a [model issue](https://github.com/dslp/dslp/blob/main/issue-types/5-model-issues.md) before proceeding.
***

**Parent:** [this issue must be associated with an "ask" issue]
**Precursor:** [this issue should reference the "experiment" issue preceding it]

### Motivation and Background
[explain why we want this model, introducing essential context and linking relevant issues as necessary]

### Model Specification
**Task:** [explain the task the model is expected to perform]

**Input:** [explain what input the model will be working with in the real world]

**Output:** [explain what model output should look like]

[you may optionally include descriptions here of model architecture, performance benchmark ratings desired, and so on; reserve detailed discussion of performance for the comments - this section is what you want the model to be, not what it's current state is]

### Deployment Progress
- [ ] Create issue branch
- [ ] [any steps necessary to creating a final model, including MLOps, go here]
- [ ] Merge into `main`
