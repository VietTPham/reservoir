# Neurons
Critical to the biological plausibility of spiking neural networks (SNNs) are the models used to represent neurons.

## Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Neurons
`lif.py` contains all LIF variants used in the lab, including ALIF.

## Adaptive Exponential Integrate-and-Fire (AdEx) Neurons
`adex.py` contains all AdEx variants used in the lab.
